# Vue Accordion
## Intro
This is 29th day of my 30-day coding challenge. In this project I use: HTML, CSS and Vue.

## Idea
I was learning about Vue and how I can use it and I thought that knowing the basics of conditional rendering allows to make an accordion component. As I was recently into lemurs (they are pretty cute, aren't they?) I themed my web into a lemur info website.

## Breaking down the code
I built my project using Vue from CDN, via a script tag placed in my HTML file. 

I made a file `app.js` where I created a const `app` that creates a new Vue application instance. 

`data() { ... }` defines teh data properties for the Vue instances. It includes boolean variables and string/numeric properties. 

Then there is `methods {...}` that consists of two methods for the Vue instance. These methods toggle the boolean values of certain properties.
