                Lemurs are exclusively found on the island of Madagascar and
                nearby Comoros Islands. Their habitat ranges from rainforests
                and dry forests to spiny forests and mountainous regions. Due to
                Madagascar's diverse ecosystems, lemurs have adapted to a
                variety of environments, showcasing their versatility in
                adapting to different ecological niches.
